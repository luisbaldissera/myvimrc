This project contains my vim setup and its goal is simply make easier to
reconfigure vim. But you opensourcer are free to use it as you wish ðŸ˜Š.

## Pre-Requisites

## Pre-configurations

Into your terminal`rc` file:

```sh
# Configure Fuzzy Finder to ignore gitignore files
export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fdfind --type f --hidden --follow --exclude .git'
```

If you have a fresh vim instalation:

* Clone recursively this repo to your `.vim` folder:
